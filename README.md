# Project 1: Personal Coach - Giovanni Sanchez

Personal Coach - Giovanni Sanchez is a site created for my personal life coach.

Sometimes we need help to achieve our next goals, but we do not know where to go, well, this site will be one place where you can get to meet a person that can provides you this support.

### Unfixed Bugs

- Inside the contact section, there are white areas on top and bottom of the background image. The idea is to fix it so that it can cover the whole area. This happens specially with mobile devices with a very considerable height (670px and more)
